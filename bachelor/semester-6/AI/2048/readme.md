## How to Play
To play the game, simply run the game script and follow the prompts:
```
python3 main.py

Use the arrow keys to move the tiles in the game board and try to reach the 2048 tile. The game ends when there are no more moves left.

## 2048 AI Solver

This project is a solver for the 2048 game, implemented in Python using the Pygame module. It includes both a playable version of the game as well as an AI solver. The AI solver uses a probability-based algorithm to calculate the best move to make in each turn.

## Requirements

This project requires the Pygame module to be installed.
