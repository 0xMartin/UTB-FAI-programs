# Affine Cipher

[GO BACK](https://github.com/0xMartin/UTB-FAI-programs)

## Description

This Python application provides an implementation of the Affine Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. It uses PyQt5 for the graphical user interface.

The Affine Cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a mathematical function to encrypt plaintext. It is a combination of two functions, one being a multiplication function and the other being an addition function.

The main executable file for this program is "affinecipher.py". It provides the user with the option to encrypt or decrypt text using the Affine Cipher algorithm.
